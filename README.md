# Online_book_store_sql
A PostgreSQL-based Online Bookstore database project demonstrating table design, relationships, and SQL queries for real-world data analysis.

📚 Online Bookstore SQL Project
This project is a relational database system designed for an Online Bookstore, implemented using PostgreSQL. It focuses on database design, data relationships, and SQL queries to analyze business data such as book inventory, customer activity, and sales performance.
